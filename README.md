# Target-Tracking-on-Counter-Battery-Radars
Kalman Filter approach to target tracking on counter-battery radars, and predictions for impact and shooting points.

# Setup
It is only needed to have Matlab installed. To install it, follow the link down bellow:
https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html

# Execution
Now for executing the script, open the ``\application\`` folder and run the ``main.m`` file to get the results in the ``\application\weights\`` directory. Keep in mind that you can always interrupt the application and resume it again.

For ploting the results, open the ``\results\`` folder execute the ``plotGraphs.m`` file.

If you wish to plot our current results instead, just drag the ``weigths.mat`` file in ``\application\our_weights\`` to ``\application\weights\`` and execute the ``plotGraphs.m`` file.
